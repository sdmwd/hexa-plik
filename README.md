Hello SadÄ±k,

I am looking for any advice with question 4 of IBM Data Science and Machine Learning Capstone Project.

I need to grade it with 4 out of 5 to pass exam. I saw your repo last week after I already sent my files and I was impressed by how you solved the first 3 questions. I got 2 fair reviews and others were very good or excellent but it graded me fair on 2 questions - and 4/5 on last.

Can you give me advice on how to solve this last question?

You can contact me : simon.durand.22 [at] gmail.com

Many thanks in advance.
